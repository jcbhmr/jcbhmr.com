title: What constitutes cheating in Minecraft singleplayer?
---

**TL;DR:** It's up to you.

**Scenario:** You want to start a Minecraft survival world. Not a Hardcore world, just a plain old survival world. What would qualify as "cheating" vs "advanced gameplay techniques"?

Is ____ cheating?

- Changing the difficulty in-game
- Using coordinates
- Using [Chunk Base](https://chunkbase.com/)
- Using [Ore Finder](https://www.orefinder.gg/)
- Using X-Ray texture pack
- Using a hacked client
- Using duplication glitches
- Using a sand duper
- Killing the Wither using Bedrock
- Abusing mob pathfinding mechanics for mob farms
- Using a schematic mod
- Using a bot mod to do tasks for you
- Glitching onto the Nether roof
- Boosting your Gamma setting to see in the dark
- Changing your FOV
- Changing your render distance
- Using an auto clicker
- Using creative mode
- Using spectator mode
- Changing the weather to clear
- Seeing your world's seed
- Opening the world to LAN and enabling cheats
- Opening the world to LAN and having a friend help you
- Using your own second account instead of a friend
- Manually changing your world's NBT data
- Using a set seed
- World backups
- Copy the world and open it in Creative mode

There's lots more.

And quite frankly how **you** choose to play a **local world** on **your own computer** is totally up to you. If you have fun playing Minecraft using a schematic mod, who am I to say that "that's technically cheating"?

## My cheating threshold for Minecraft survival mode

_This is written by someone who plays [Minecraft for Windows](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/minecraft-for-windows/9nblggh2jhxj)_

Mojang already has a guide for what is and isn't considered cheating in vanilla survival Minecraft: **Are achievements enabled if you do that?**

But that doesn't do enough for me. I don't like the idea that editing some NBT data is "not cheating because it didn't trigger the 'achievements disabled' screen".

Let's try this: **"Anything that would disable achievements is cheating. No external tool may modify the running or saved game."** For example DLL injection, memory editing, file editing, mods, alternative clients, etc. are all not allowed. That covers pretty much everything that I want it to.

**Changing the difficulty back and forth to Peaceful is allowed?** \
 It makes it easy to cheese mobs, yes, but it is a setting that you can change in survival mode. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Why is using an X-Ray texture pack _not_ considered cheating?** \
You're getting more ores for a cumbersome hassle. The effort you have to put into using X-Ray is similar to the effort of regular spelunking.

**Why are Chunk Base and Ore Finder allowed?** \
Chunk Base is necessary to find slime chunks. Once you open it up to determining slime chunks you might as well open it up to allow any external tool.

**Why are world backups & copies allowed?** \
Because there's a tradeoff: you lose all progress made since the save. This is _survival_ mode, not _hardcore_ mode so a death isn't as significant.

**Why are glitches allowed?** \
They're there and you're going to encounter them even if you don't abuse them.

**Wait, auto clickers are OK?** \
Yes. If you're able to have an [auto clicker mouse](https://www.amazon.com/auto-clicker-mouse/s?k=auto+clicker+mouse) you might as well be able to do that programmatically.
