title: Andor season 2 is really good
---

_Contains spoilers_

I think most of Andor season 2 is good.

First, to recap:

- Andor S1 is a whole season 5 years before the Death Star was destroyed.
- Andor S2 is 4x 3-episode arcs, each 1 year after the previous arc, leading up to the events directly preceding Rogue One which directly precedes A New Hope which is how the Death Star is destroyed.

### The meh arc

The first arc in Andor S2 is not the best of the 4. It's four story lines:

1. Andor stealing a prototype TIE fighter and being prisoner of a marooned crew on Yavin IV.
2. Bix and Brasso trying to evade Imperial immigration enforcement.
3. Mon Mothma marrying off her daughter to a wealthy family to ally with a banker guy.
4. Dedra Meero being part of a plan to get Kalkite from Ghorman

This arc doesn't really have much immediate meaning to the audience. At least, it didn't to me. I get why all of these things are important to the story but this arc suffers from the "could be skipped" problem. If you rewatch S2 again, would you skip this arc?

It's known that this season of ander could have been stretched into four full seasons, each one a year closer to the Death Star's destruction but was condensed into a single S2 because it was impractical for such a long commitment to be made.

This first arc could have been better if it were given time to be more detailed. When we start the first episode of this arc, Cassian has already left Bix and Brasso behind on the farm planet. What if instead it started with the "the mission should you choose to accept it" sort of start and then an emotional goodbye with a promise to return before anything bad happens? This would have gien Brasso's death more weight because we saw them part ways.

I don't really know what I'm talking about. Do I want less of this arc or more? In general I'm just a bit _meh_ about this arc. I think it's the weakest of the four.

But don't worry things get better.

### The prep arc

Now Ghorman is set up as an important flashpoint for the Rebellion. We get two spy stories: one where Dedra and Syril are manipulating the Ghorman resistance and one where Kleya is doing a daring sky gadget extraction from a piece of art.

This arc develops Dedra and Syril more. That's good. In the next arc this pays off. This arc also has the excellent Kleya, Mon Mothma, and Orson Krennic scene where they discuss war and Kleya retrieves the sky microphone.

The Saw Gerrera part of this arc is weaker. It shows Saw being extreme. That's about it.

I don't really haev much to say other than that this is a good arc. Better than the first arc, but not as good as the next two.

### The Ghorman finale arc

This is the second part of the previous arc. Building on Dedra and Syril's manipulation of the Ghorman resistance, we now get a massacre by the Empire. And that's not the end! We get another sky-like escape mission to extract Mon Mothma from the senate building.

This arc completes the Syril/Dedra story line.

This is just a great arc. The two-parter of the Ghorman setup and now the Ghorman massacre is quite good.

Also Bix leaves to keep Cassian focused on the Rebellion.

### The setup for Rouge One arc

This is the best of the four. 10/10. All three of these episodes are great. Because there's so much that happens in so little time these episodes feel packed with content. This is a stark departure from the first arc which felt like it was too little plot development stretched over too much screen time.

This is less of an arc for our characters and more of just a setup for Rouge One. And that's OK! That's great! That means that you don't need to worry about the "but wait, what happens to this incomplete information about the Death Star? The series ends without a resolution!" because the resolution is in Rouge One and A New Hope. This arc just focuses on the beats, the actions, the steps, the _messengers_ (callback to episode 7) who carry the information step by step with their sacrifices to reach Yavin which eventually leads to another round of sacrifice handoffs of the Death Star plans in Rouge One and again in A New Hope and finally the destruction of the Death Star.

To put everything together, if you want to just watch the best stuff:

- Watch the entirety of season 1
- Skip the first arc of season 2
- Watch the 2nd and 3rd episodes of the second arc
- Maybe skip the first episode of the third arc?
- Watch the third arc
- Watch the fourth arc with popcorn
- Watch Rouge One
- Watch A New Hope

But it's all actually still pretty good. Andor as a whole is really good. Best Star Wars TV show. Even the weaker arcs are still pretty good. Cinematography is great, actors are great, VFX are great, writing is great. It's all great.

This entire review is just so I coujld organize my thoughts and write down that final list of "what to watch" because I want to be able to point people (like future me) to this list of "what to watch for the Andor experience" in the future.
