title: HelloFresh recipes are awesome
---

HelloFresh is a subscription service that sends you meal kits with a bunch of fresh (get it? Hello*Fresh*?) ingredients with a recipe card that you then cook yourself into a meal. The service itself is cool too, but I like their recipe selection myself. Instead of picking one entree recipe like "Salmon with sauce" from ALlRecipes and then trying to find a suitable side dish only _after_ you've put the fish in the oven is not great for the overall cohesiveness of the meal. HelloFresh recipes solve this problem by giving you a **complete meal recipe** including sauces, garnish, and sides. For example, their meatloaf recipe isn't just a meatloaf. It's a meatloaf, a sauce, mashed potatoes, and roasted green beans.

And how could I forget the excellent visual presentation? They have **so many pictures** it's **great**!

The recipes even comes with pictures for each step in the directions:

This is really helpful when you're wondering what "cut crosswise with diagonal incisions" means. You just look at the picture and copy that.

I really like HelloFresh's recipe cards.

Here's another reason to like them: they make it very easy to buy all the things you need for a week's worth of meals at the grocery store. You choose 6-7 recipes for the week, itemize the ingredients, ignore the basic ones that you already have, and buy that. No more "I think we can make chicken this week" and then "oops, I didn't buy honey mustard for this sauce recipe I wanted to make for the chicken". The whole-meal recipes give you the upfront ingredients that you need to plan a shopping trip that gets everything you need.
