title: "Animal Rating: The House Finch"
---

The House Finch is the avian equivalent of that friend who can turn any mundane situation into a party. Think about it. You never see just one house finch. There's always a whole [chirping of finches](https://allcollectivenouns.com/animal/collective-noun-for-finches). House finches are true extroverts.

#### Special powers

Female house finches are grayish brown. That's their special power. Kinda a second-rate ability if you ask me. But they do naturally blend in with the background of tree branches and bark or that spot in your backyard that was originally a flower bed but is now an unkempt carpet of brown and gray leaves. There's just one problem: the house finch is too stupid to know that it's hidden and breaks the illusion with loud chirping noises and jerky head movements.

**Bonus power:** Amusing cuteness. The House Finch is equipped with a powerful charm spell that compels humans to put out more birdseed. Tell me you haven't fallen victim to it. Go on, I'm waiting.

#### Weaknesses

**Cats.**

And being misidentified as a sparrow.

#### Number of legs

Two, but they don't walk.

#### Rise of modern House Finch Empire

The House Finch empire has drastically increased in the last few decades. Soon they may even colonize the United States' flat barren pancake states that currently split the Finch nation in two.

#### What if it fought a bear?

It would fly away.

**Bonus fight: What if it fought a human?** Finch flies away **but** since the human giveth the food, so the human can taketh away. The human wins in the long run.

#### Is it noble?

Not particularly. The House Finch is more of a commoner, the working class of the bird world.

#### Final rating

Very good cat entertainment if the cat is prevented from initiating combat. Tends to get confused with other common birdfeeder birds. When you see a red-plume male house finch it's pretty unique. They may not be the noblest of birds, but they sure know how to make a birdfeeder feel like it's a popular hangout. Generally a good suburban mini-animal.

**7/10**
