title: Guacamole recipe

This is very vague. Use whatever amount looks good.

- Avocados
- Tomato bits
- A bit of raw onion bits
- Lime juice
- Garlic or garlic powder
- Salt & pepper
- Any other seasonings you like i.e. spicy powder or hot sauce


For 4 people use about 2 avocados and 2 roma tomatoes.
