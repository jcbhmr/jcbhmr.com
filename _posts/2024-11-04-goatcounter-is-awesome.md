1. **It's free**
2. **It counts _unique_ page views**
3. **[It <sup>(probably)</sup> doesn't require a consent notice](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/gdpr) 🎉**

Seriously. It's much easier than setting up Google Analytics and configuring a cookie consent popup. It's also more user-friendly (due to the lack of said popup).

Here are some screenshots of the GoatCounter dashboard information that you could expect to see:

GoatCounter is a page view counter. It does that quite well. It is not a marketing analytics tool to track user behavior with custom events across sessions. For me, that's perfect. If you have a demo site, if you're publishing a static site blog, if you're experimenting with new web APIs on GitHub Pages, or anything else where you _just want a good page counter_ consider GoatCounter. So far I like it. The lack of a required GDPR consent notice is 🤩awesome. It's literally just a `<script>` tag with nothing else needed.

<sup>P.S. GoatCounter also offers [an `<img>` tracking pixel counting mechanism](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/pixel) if you don't like JavaScript</sup>
